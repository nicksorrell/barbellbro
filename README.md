# BarbellBro
A simple **work in-progess** application for calculating barbell loads at the gym.

Built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com). _Eventually_ PhoneGap.

## Installation
Simply clone the repo:

`.git clone https://github.com/nicksorrell/barbellbro.git`

## How to Run

For in-development testing, simply run a local server of your choice (e.g., XAMPP, Python) and load to _index.html_ in the browser with mobile device emulation active.

For more information on how to emulate mobile devices in the browser, visit the [Google developers site](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/?hl=en).

## How it Works
The core functionality of the app is calculating the plates to use on a barbell to load a specific weight. The app allows users to customize their plate sets and plate availability to work best for them as well.

Things like settings and configuration are handled by loading page snippets into Bootstrap modals.
