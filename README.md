# BarbellBro
A simple application for calculating barbell loads at the gym.

Version 1.0.0 was released on Google's Play Store in March 2015!

Built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), and [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).

## Installation
Simply clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/nicksorrell/barbellbro.git`

## How to Run

For basic testing, simply run a local server of your choice (e.g., XAMPP, Python) and load _index.html_ in the browser with mobile device emulation active. Using the PhoneGap tool suite is highly recommended for in-depth testing on mobile devices.

For more information on how to emulate mobile devices in the browser, visit the [Google developers site](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/?hl=en).

## How it Works
The core functionality of the app is calculating the plates to use on a barbell to load a specific weight. The app allows users to customize their plate sets and plate availability to work best for them as well.

Things like settings and configuration are handled by loading page templates in Bootstrap modals.
